# OpenAI File Analysis and Fixes

## Issues Found

### 1. **Critical Async/Await Issue** ❌
**Problem**: The `getEmbeddings` function was not marked as `async` but was being called with `await` in other functions.
```python
# Before (incorrect)
def getEmbeddings(text):
    response = openai_client.embeddings.create(...)
    return embeddings

# After (fixed)
async def getEmbeddings(text):
    response = await openai_client.embeddings.create(...)
    return embeddings
```

### 2. **Redundant OpenAI Client Initialization** ❌
**Problem**: Both `_openai.py` and `assembly.py` were initializing their own OpenAI clients.
```python
# Before (redundant)
# _openai.py
openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# assembly.py  
openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# After (centralized)
# openai_utils.py
openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

### 3. **Duplicate System Prompts** ❌
**Problem**: Nearly identical system prompts in `ask` function and `ask_meeting` function.
```python
# Before (duplicated)
# _openai.py and assembly.py had nearly identical prompts

# After (shared)
AI_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
AI assistant is a brand new, powerful, human-like artificial intelligence.
...
"""
```

### 4. **Weaviate Data Structure Issue** ❌
**Problem**: Trying to insert `id` and `vector` as properties, which is forbidden.
```python
# Before (incorrect)
objects_to_upsert.append({
    "id": hashlib.md5(doc.page_content.encode()).hexdigest(),  # ❌ Forbidden
    "properties": {...},
    "vector": doc.metadata["embeddings"]  # ❌ Should be at root level
})

# After (fixed)
objects_to_upsert.append({
    "properties": {...},
    "vector": doc.metadata["embeddings"]  # ✅ At root level
})
```

### 5. **Inconsistent Error Handling** ❌
**Problem**: Different functions had different error handling patterns.
```python
# Before (inconsistent)
try:
    response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
    return response.choices[0].message.content
except Exception as e:
    print(f"OpenAI API error: {e}")
    return "fallback message"

# After (consistent)
result = await create_chat_completion(messages)
if result:
    return result
else:
    return "fallback message"
```

### 6. **Missing Import Issues** ❌
**Problem**: When refactoring to use shared utilities, some required imports were removed.
```python
# Before (missing import)
from openai_utils import get_embeddings, create_chat_completion, create_context_system_prompt
# Missing: import os

# After (fixed)
import os
from openai_utils import get_embeddings, create_chat_completion, create_context_system_prompt
```

### 7. **Async Function Call Issues** ❌
**Problem**: Async functions were being called without `await` in list comprehensions.
```python
# Before (incorrect)
embeddings = [get_embeddings(doc.metadata["summary"]) for doc in raw_documents]

# After (fixed)
embeddings = await asyncio.gather(
    *[get_embeddings(doc.metadata["summary"]) for doc in raw_documents]
)
```

### 8. **Weaviate API Changes** ❌
**Problem**: The Weaviate API changed and no longer accepts `vector` parameter.
```python
# Before (incorrect)
query_response = index.query.near_vector(
    vector=query_vector,  # ❌ No longer supported
    limit=10,
    return_properties=["source", "code", "summary"]
)

# After (fixed)
query_response = index.query.near_vector(
    query_vector,  # ✅ Direct parameter
    limit=10,
    return_properties=["source", "code", "summary"]
)
```

### 9. **Coroutine Not Awaited** ❌
**Problem**: The `summarise_commit` function was being called without `await`.
```python
# Before (incorrect)
@app.post("/summarise-commit")
def summariseCommits(body: summariseCommitBody):
    summary = summarise_commit(str(response.content[:10000]))  # ❌ Coroutine not awaited

# After (fixed)
@app.post("/summarise-commit")
async def summariseCommits(body: summariseCommitBody):
    summary = await summarise_commit(str(response.content[:10000]))  # ✅ Properly awaited
```

### 10. **Embeddings Error Handling** ❌
**Problem**: No handling for failed embeddings that return `None`.
```python
# Before (no error handling)
for i, doc in enumerate(docs):
    doc.metadata["embeddings"] = embeddings[i]  # ❌ Could be None

# After (with error handling)
if any(emb is None for emb in embeddings):
    print("Warning: Some embeddings failed, skipping Weaviate insertion")
    return summaries
```

### 11. **Weaviate Client Connection** ❌
**Problem**: Weaviate client was not connected before use.
```python
# Before (not connected)
client = WeaviateClient(...)
index = client.collections.get("chatpdf")  # ❌ Client not connected

# After (connected)
client = WeaviateClient(...)
client.connect()  # ✅ Connect first
index = client.collections.get("chatpdf")
```

### 12. **Graceful Weaviate Failure Handling** ❌
**Problem**: No handling for Weaviate connection failures.
```python
# Before (no error handling)
client.connect()
index = client.collections.get("chatpdf")

# After (with error handling)
try:
    client.connect()
    index = client.collections.get("chatpdf")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Warning: Could not connect to Weaviate: {e}")
    index = None
```

### 13. **Weaviate Authentication Issues** ❌
**Problem**: Weaviate cloud instance requires authentication but the API configuration was incorrect.
```python
# Before (incorrect auth)
client = weaviate.WeaviateClient(
    connection_params=weaviate.connect.ConnectionParams.from_url(
        url="https://asia-southeast1-gcp-free.weaviate.network",
        grpc_port=50051  # ❌ No authentication
    )
)

# After (temporarily disabled)
print("⚠️ Weaviate connection disabled - using fallback mode")
client = None
index = None
```
